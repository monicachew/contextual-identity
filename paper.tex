\section{Introduction}

People reveal different aspects of themselves depending on context. At any
given time, they may be acting as a friend, relative, spouse, co-worker,
acquaintance, or stranger. This observation is not new; Erving Goffman called
this impression management, and Carl Jung called it persona
theory~\cite{goffman,jung}. In this short paper, we call it contextual identity.
%identity as social construct?

Helen Nissenbaum has long argued that privacy violations come not from the
simple sharing of personal information, but rather from sharing that
information in a way that violates social norms, or in the wrong
context~\cite{nissenbaum}. The desire for spontaneous, positive human
interaction often leads to sharing personal information. For example, take
PatientsLikeMe~\cite{patientslikeme}. This site functions as a support group
and as a place for people to share health information, such as drug regimens,
treatment history, side-effects, and more. Though this information is
traditionally considered extremely sensitive, the users of this site clearly
value the benefits of sharing: longitudinal graphs of their own health history,
building community with people who share their disease. Further, sharing
personal information does not mean that the users don't value
privacy~\cite{boyd2}. Selling user data originally intended for one purpose for
another (e.g., to insurance companies to discover uninsurable patients) would
be a gross violation of users' privacy expectations.

%this story is a positive story to shock security folk with the breadth and
%depth of personal information that ordinary users will share
% instead we could lead with a shocking, negative story like how gay youth get
% killed when they're outed

In offline environments, managing contextual identities is more intuitive than
in online environments. There are cues to help you determine where you are,
who your intended audience is, how many people will overhear you, and how
likely your information is to be re-broadcast in a different context. It is
also true that in offline environments, humans don't have perfect memories and
will eventually forget.  However, with the advent of increasingly vast
searching, indexing, and archiving capabilities, one cannot rely on forgetting
in online environments~\cite{delete}. Thus, managing contextual identities
online has become increasingly difficult and fraught with mistakes.

One possible solution to this problem is never to post personal information
online, or at least to consider the entire world might be the audience.
However, this solution defies human nature. Given that there are 1 billion
active Facebook users and that 30-40\% of spoken communication is devoted to
informing others about ourselves, humans are bound to fall short of these
guidelines~\cite{tamir,fbusers}. The security and privacy community should
recognize this and develop techniques to meet users' needs rather than
expecting human nature to change.

We provide a simple formalization of the notion of contextual identity, use it
as a framework to understand existing privacy violations, and analyze
mitigations for those violations.

\section{Related Work}

Many authors have discovered attacks to link different contextual identities to
the same person. Narayanan and Shmatikov present a re-identification technique
to merge anonymized social graphs from different networks and prove that
user identifiers from Netflix and IMDB and Flickr and Twitter can be
linked~\cite{narayanan1,narayanan2}. Lindamood et al.~and Mislove et al.~show
how to infer previously undisclosed information from released social networking
data~\cite{lindamood,mislove}.

Many authors have noted how re-broadcasting information information out of
context and making information discoverable can lead to user distress, even if
the information was previously public, but not easily
discoverable~\cite{boyd1,chew,nissenbaum}.

Barth et al.~provide a formal model for contextual integrity of user
data~\cite{barth}. The contextual integrity model focuses on the flow of
personal information in terms of knowledge states held by agents rather than on
user identity, and works well for modeling privacy legislation and policy. In
contrast, this work's model provides a simple framework to understand users'
ability to represent which contextual identity they want to project, and works
well for modeling how software features affect users' ability to assert choice
and control.

\begin{comment}TODO: figure out how to cite this. Why is this short
paper's model worth pursuing? It's simpler, and focuses on the user rather
than data.
\end{comment}

Although network inference and merging attacks are very powerful, at the
current time they require a level of expertise and resources not available to
most people. A brief survey of social networking
advice reveals that the
major causes of concern come not from a dedicated social graph expert, but people
close to the user: friends, family, and co-workers~\cite{fbtips2,fbtips1}.
Surveys conducted by Wang et al.~show that typical regrets from posting on
Facebook stem almost exclusively from fear of negative interactions with people
that the user knows~\cite{wang}. The consequences of these negative
interactions can lead to loss of employment or breaking personal relationships.
Most previous privacy research has focused on distant adversaries, where the
bad actor is a behavioral tracking service, state agent or unknown
eavesdropper; in contrast, we assert that users care more about their
interactions with others close to them.

\section{Contextual identity violations}
\label{sec:examples}
\subsection{Redistributing information out of context}
Re-distributing information out of its original context often leads to
embarrassment~\cite{nissenbaum}.  In November 2007, Facebook Beacon allowed
third-party sites to publish purchases, travel bookings, movie rentals and more to the
user's activity stream.  Because of poor opt-out and lack of visibility into
what was being published, user outcry was immediate~\cite{mccarthy,nakashima}.
In December 2007, Google Reader exposed RSS feeds of user-marked news stories
to the user's Google Talk contacts\footnote{Google Talk contacts are everyone
with whom a user has chatted, which might include co-workers, supervisors, and
friends}. Although this feed was always public, prior to this launch it was not
discoverable, leading to a bad experience for many users~\cite{helft}. In
February 2010, Google Buzz launched, a product that
exposed the user's most frequent Gmail and Google Talk contacts and their
publicly available (through previously less discoverable) news and photos.  The
combination of exposing contacts (which could include abusive ex-husbands,
co-workers, and friends), as well as aggressively linking photos and news
items, resulted in a huge backlash~\cite{fugitivus,buzz}. In September 2012,
Facebook imported old wall posts from 2008 into the new Timeline interface.
Although wall posts were always visible from profile pages, the new Timeline
interface brought old wall posts which users used to treat as private
messages, before the advent of ``Like'' and comment buttons, to the attention
of an audience that the user never anticipated~\cite{timeline}.

\subsection{Unsatisfiable policies}
\label{sec:policies}
Some service providers have policies which preclude isolating multiple
contextual identities. For example, Facebook and Google have a ``Real Names'' policy, which
requires users to register for accounts with their legal
name~\cite{fb_names,google_names}.  These policies presume the users can be one
person to everyone. These policies ignore that community-building happens in
many different contexts, that users have many legitimate reasons for presenting
different identities in different contexts, and that users don't necessarily
want those identities to be linked. For example, disallowing avatar handles as
a primary identifier makes building a gaming community difficult. 
Linking a gaming identity to a professional identity has already caused
problems for 2012 Maine Senate candidate and World of Warcraft gamer Colleen
Lachowicz~\cite{maine}.

It is impossible for users who want to isolate multiple contextual identities
to participate in these networks without violating the terms of service.  The
``Real Names'' policy prohibits users from asserting control over their identity.

\subsection{User interface errors}
Even in the absence of changes made by service providers to re-contextualize
personal information, it is all too easy for users to broadcast information to
an unintended audience. This phenomenon is so common on Twitter that it has its
own name, ``DM fail'', or Direct Message fail: when the user posts a public
message instead of a private, direct message. Representative Anthony Weiner was
a victim of this mistake when he inadvertently sent compromising pictures of
himself publicly~\cite{weiner}. Considering that this mistake requires
mistyping a single character (\texttt{@} instead of \texttt{d}), it's no
surprise that DM failures are exceedingly common.

Similar to DM failures, posting to the wrong account is also a common mistake.
Because many jobs require posting on social networks on behalf of the company,
it is common to have multiple accounts for personal and business use.
KitchenAid, Chrysler, and Google are three companies whose employees have
made this mistake in the past year~\cite{kitchenaid,chrysler,yegge}.

\subsection{Federated login}
\label{sec:login}
Facebook Connect is a login platform that allows third-party websites to
authenticate users using their Facebook identity~\cite{fb_connect}. Because it
is against the terms of service to have multiple Facebook accounts, using
Facebook Connect has the unwanted side-effect of linking multiple contextual
identities.

Similar to section~\ref{sec:policies}, many federated login systems simply
don't have the ability to allow users multiple identifiers.
Other federated login systems have support for multiple identifiers, but
this feature can be poorly implemented or difficult to discover, leading to
low use.
Some login platforms and protocols, such as OAuth and BrowserID,
do not suffer from this policy or design error~\cite{browserid,oauth},
giving a user better control over which contextual identity to assert.

\subsection{Third party tracking}
\label{sec:tracking}
Even if a user does not participate in social networks, they are still subject
to tracking by virtue of browsing the web. Third-party cookies, flash cookies,
web bugs, device fingerprinting, geolocation, history sniffing and more are
techniques that a dedicated third party could use to collect browsing history
and link contextual identities through correlation of tasks.

\section{Possible mitigations}

\subsection{Inferring contextual identities}
Accurately detecting the user's current contextual identity, whether
heuristically or through asking the user, is paramount to helping the user
manage it.
Although a user may subconsciously be aware of their contextual identities,
expecting users to enumerate their identities and manually curate them is
probably too burdensome. Firefox has a Profile Manager, but it is so difficult to use that it will be removed.\footnote{See \url{https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=214675\#c53}}.

Tang et al.~show that most people do not take the time to create labels and
maintain friend lists~\cite{tang}. However, the same authors show how to use
heterogeneous networks to infer relationship types (e.g., manager-subordinate)
though the graph itself is unlabeled.

It may also be possible to infer tasks from the user's activity. For example,
the \texttt{about:profile} Firefox extension uses the Open Directory Project
and Alexa to categorize URLs that the user has visited~\cite{aboutprofile}.

\subsection{Automatic mitigations for information leakage}
Given a set of relationships and tasks, one can categorize a user's
contextual identities and prevent information leakage between them.  For
example, preventing third-party cookies from being read and set across task
boundaries means that targeted ads for dating would not follow the user when
visiting a technology news site. Knowing the user's current contextual identity
also allows the browser to suppress URL bar suggestions that aren't relevant to
that identity, protecting the user from both shoulder-surfing and distraction.

Privacy modes in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera are a good first step, but
are no means a complete solution~\cite{ABBJ10}. There is no standard behavior
for private browsing mode, and thus interaction with extensions, treatment of
cookies, history, and bookmarks upon entering and exiting this mode are
different and serve different use cases. Depending on user desire, the threat
model for using private browsing mode may be other household members, or it may
be a service to which the user wants to limit cookie leakage.

Another partial solution is to prompt the user when they're about to link
multiple contextual identities through a federated login service. For example,
Persona is the suite of tools that implements the BrowserID protocol, and it
supports multiple email identifiers~\cite{browserid}.
Because we can categorize the type of service by URL
as \texttt{about:profile} does, Persona could prompt the user when they're about
to link the same email identifier to radically different contextual identities,
such as ones for dating and professional use.

\subsection{Expiring contextual identities}
Oftentimes a user may have a long-term task, such as wedding planning or house
buying, that requires constructing a contextual identity. The tasks associated
with this identity have an externally imposed end date and may have long-lived
side-effects, such as long-term cookies that reveal sensitive information
(e.g., the neighborhood of the house purchase, income information derived from
purchases, other demographic data). For contextual identities that have
outlived their usefulness, users would benefit from destruction of side-effects
such as cookie data.

\subsection{Recovering from Mistakes}
\subsubsection{Auditing}
A major cause of user embarrassment is exposing information to the wrong
audience, as illustrated in section~\ref{sec:examples}. A browser is in an
ideal position to intermediate social network posts, aggregate them locally,
and present them to the user when they desire to audit their digital footprint.
For example, a user could see all of the comments and posts they made in the
last week and redact content that is sensitive or too negative, a frequent cause
of regret~\cite{wang}. 
 Although this approach does not help when the service
provider decides to change the audience on the user's behalf, auditing gives the user a good opportunity to review posts that
might cause regrets. In the case of high-volume users, such a tool could
incorporate sentiment analysis to aid the user in finding particularly
problematic content.

Profiles can be generated by user-supplied application-level data, but also
implicitly through browsing via techniques in Section~\ref{sec:tracking}. Collusion is a
tool for visualizing cookies~\cite{collusion}, in particular third-party
cookies set by tracking sites which are typically ad networks.  Once the user
knows which sites are tracking them, they can choose to block cookies from
those sites.

\subsubsection{Remembering to Forget}
Humans don't have perfect memories, and perhaps social
networks should not either~\cite{delete}. Many users already engage in manual auditing and
deletion of old posts~\cite{fbtips2}. A better solution would be to build tools
that let the user manage this more easily through an API: both Twitter and Facebook provide
APIs for deletion\footnote{At the time of this writing, Google Plus offers a
read-only API}. One way to reduce the likelihood of linked contextual
identities would be to provide applications that expire posts after some time.
Deletion and expiration also reduce the likely audience especially in the case of public posts

\subsection{Preventing Mistakes}
\subsubsection{Controlling Information Flow}
Sometimes a user might want to prevent mistakes from being made in the first
place. If a user is concerned about a particular service provider, they can
install an extension like Disconnect to disallow cookies from that provider
unless they explicitly want to interact with that site~\cite{disconnect}.
This type of tool (cookie blocker) helps users assert control over audience.

Protocols like Do Not Track are also a good first step to solving this
problem~\cite{dnt}. Although Do Not Track is unenforceable from the client
side, it provides a clear signal to service providers and ad networks
that the user does not want to be tracked. As adoption increases, ignoring this
signal will lead to loss of reputation for service providers that explicitly
act against their users' wishes, helping
users assert control over the effects of their actions.

\subsubsection{Visual reminders of context}
To mitigate privacy violations caused by poor user interfaces, the onus must be
on software developers to provide sufficient visual cues of context. For
example, many but not all Google products support multiple accounts. However,
the visual cue to indicate which account is active is a small, easy to ignore
text name at the top right of the page.

Much work has been done for visual verification of domain authenticity in the
context of phishing, but not much has been done for visual verification of
which user credentials are active~\cite{skins}.

\section{Open problems}
We are largely ignorant of the ways in which users think about contextual
identity. Building usable software to manage contextual identity demands
further research.

The mitigations proposed in this work become more complex in the face of shared
devices and overlapping identities. There are good reasons to want to intermix
work and personal identities (increased exposure, serendipitous connections)
and so many people use the same account for both personal and work reasons.

Mobile growth is driving most internet growth, and much of that growth comes
developing countries. The literature on how device sharing works in those
markets is completely lacking. Managing contextual identities on shared devices
promises to be a difficult problem.

\section{Discussion}
People have multiple contextual identities. Sharing personal information in
those contexts is a great way to foster positive human interaction.  We hope
that contextual identity will serve as a framework for both developers to
understand their users' privacy needs, and to develop tools that allow users to
act in their contextual identities in a spontaneous, relaxed, and interesting
way.
