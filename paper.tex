\begin{abstract}
We examine \textit{contextual identity}, a notion that individuals reveal
different aspects of themselves depending on context. At any given time, they
may act as a friend, relative, spouse, co-worker, aquaintance, or stranger. We
analyze contextual identity from the perspective of user choice and control,
survey contextual identity violations, and propose new resesarch directions to
empower users to have better control over their contextual identities.

\section{Introduction}
\begin{quote}I am large, I contain multitudes. --- Walt Whitman,
\begin{em}Song of Myself\end{em} \end{quote}

The desire for spontaneous, positive human interaction often requires sharing
personal information. Sharing information can obviously lead to loss of
privacy, but the act of sharing alone does not negate expectation of
privacy~\cite{boyd2}.  Helen Nissenbaum has long argued that privacy violations
come not from the simple sharing of personal information, but rather from
sharing that information in a way that violates social norms, or in the wrong
context~\cite{nissenbaum}.

We consider it a contextual identity violation when
multiple contextual identities are linked without the user's permission, or the
user cannot control which contextual identity is presented to a given audience.

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered youth are a prime example of this.
Access to support is crucial for LGTB-identified youth who are at higher risk
for bullying and suicide than non-LGTB youth, and much of that support is only
accessible through the Internet in socially conservative areas~\cite{hrc}. In
2011 Bobbi Duncan and Taylor McCormick, two students at the University of Texas
at Austin, were inadvertantly outed when their choir director added them to a
Facebook group for Queer Chorus~\cite{fowler}. Even though both students had
blocked their parents from seeing any personal posts revealing their sexuality,
because Queer Chorus is a public group Facebook published notifications to
Duncan's and McCormick's friends, including their parents. Duncan later
attempted suicide~\cite{duncan}.

In offline environments, managing contextual identities is more intuitive than
in online environments. There are cues to help you determine where you are,
who your intended audience is, how many people will overhear you, and how
likely your information is to be re-broadcast in a different context. It is
also true that in offline environments, humans don't have perfect memories and
will eventually forget.  However, with the advent of increasingly vast
searching, indexing, and archiving capabilities, one cannot rely on forgetting
in online environments~\cite{delete}. Managing contextual identities
online has become increasingly difficult and fraught with mistakes; we must
provide users with better tools to control their contextual identities.

\section{Related Work}

The notion that individuals inhabit multiple personas has existed in multiple
fields for many years; Erving Goffman called this impression management, and
Carl Jung called it persona theory~\cite{goffman,jung}.

Barth, Datta, Mitchell, and Nissenbaum provide a formal model for contextual
integrity of user data~\cite{barth}. The contextual integrity model focuses on
the flow of personal information in terms of knowledge states held by agents
acting in given roles, and works well for modeling privacy legislation such as
HIPPA and COPPA. Two drawbacks of this work are that it is incapable of
modeling information where the subject involves more than one person, and it
only takes the type of information into account rather than the content or tone
of the information.  Thus, the event ``Bob told Alice that Charlie cooked a
delicious dinner'' is out of scope of the model.  In the context of social
networks, information is rarely ever about a single person, and the tone of the
message is as important to user happiness as the content of the message.

Many authors have discovered attacks to link different contextual identities to
the same person. Narayanan and Shmatikov present a re-identification technique
to merge anonymized social graphs from different networks and prove that
user identifiers from Netflix and IMDB and Flickr and Twitter can be
linked~\cite{narayanan1,narayanan2}. Lindamood et al.~and Mislove et al.~show
how to infer previously undisclosed information from released social networking
data~\cite{lindamood,mislove}.

Many authors have noted how re-broadcasting information information out of
context and making information discoverable can lead to user distress, even if
the information was previously public, but not easily
discoverable~\cite{boyd1,chew,nissenbaum}.

Evidence suggests that users' major privacy concerns come from people the user
knows: friends, family, and co-workers~\cite{fbtips2,fbtips1}.  Surveys
conducted by Wang et al.~suggest that typical regrets from posting on Facebook
stem almost exclusively from fear of negative interactions with people that the
user knows~\cite{wang}. The consequences of these negative interactions can
lead to loss of employment or breaking personal relationships.  Most previous
privacy research has focused on distant adversaries, where the bad actor is a
behavioral tracking service, state agent or unknown eavesdropper; in contrast,
we assert that users care more about their interactions with others close to
them.

\section{Contextual identity violations}
\label{sec:examples}
\subsection{Redistributing information out of context}
Re-distributing information out of its original context often leads to
embarrassment~\cite{nissenbaum}.  In November 2007, Facebook Beacon allowed
third-party sites to publish purchases, travel bookings, movie rentals and more
to the user's activity stream.  Because of poor opt-out and lack of visibility
into what was being published, user outcry was
immediate~\cite{mccarthy,nakashima}.  In December 2007, Google Reader exposed
RSS feeds of user-marked news stories to the user's Google Talk contacts, which
includes everyone with whom a user has chatted whether they be co-workers,
supervisors, or friends. Although this feed was always public, prior to this
launch it was not discoverable, leading to a bad experience for many
users~\cite{helft}. In February 2010, Google Buzz launched, a product that
exposed the user's most frequent Gmail and Google Talk contacts and their
publicly available (through previously less discoverable) news and photos.  The
combination of exposing contacts (which could include abusive ex-husbands,
co-workers, and friends), as well as aggressively linking photos and news
items, resulted in a huge backlash~\cite{fugitivus,buzz}. In September 2012,
Facebook imported old wall posts from 2008 into the new Timeline interface.
Although wall posts were always visible from profile pages, the new Timeline
interface brought old wall posts which users used to treat as private messages,
before the advent of ``Like'' and comment buttons, to the attention of an
audience that the user never anticipated~\cite{timeline}.

\subsection{Unsatisfiable policies}
\label{sec:policies}
Some service providers have policies which preclude isolating multiple
contextual identities. For example, Facebook and Google have a ``Real Names''
policy, which requires users to register for accounts with their legal
name~\cite{fb_names,google_names}.  These policies ignore that
community-building happens in many different contexts, that users have many
legitimate reasons for presenting different identities in different contexts,
and that users don't necessarily want those identities to be linked. For
example, disallowing avatar handles as a primary identifier makes building a
gaming community difficult.  Linking a gaming identity to a professional
identity has already caused problems for 2012 Maine Senate candidate and World
of Warcraft gamer Colleen Lachowicz~\cite{maine}.

It is impossible for users who want to isolate multiple contextual identities
to participate in these networks without violating the terms of service.  The
``Real Names'' policy prohibits users from asserting control over their
identity.

Even worse, many of these providers now serve as login platforms for external
sites, spreading these unsatisfiable policies outside the service providers
themselves.  Facebook Connect is a login platform that allows third-party
websites to authenticate users using their Facebook identity~\cite{fb_connect}.
Because it is against the terms of service to have multiple Facebook accounts,
using Facebook Connect has the unwanted side-effect of linking multiple
contextual identities.

Other federated login systems have support for multiple identifiers, but this
feature can be poorly implemented or difficult to discover, leading to low use.
Some login platforms and protocols, such as OAuth and BrowserID, do not suffer
from this policy or design error~\cite{browserid,oauth}, giving a user better
control over which contextual identity to assert.

\subsection{User interface errors}
It is all too easy for users to broadcast information to
an unintended audience. This phenomenon is so common on Twitter that it has its
own name, ``DM fail'', or Direct Message fail: when the user posts a public
message instead of a private, direct message. Representative Anthony Weiner was
a victim of this mistake when he inadvertently sent compromising pictures of
himself publicly~\cite{weiner}. Considering that this mistake requires
mistyping a single character (\texttt{@} instead of \texttt{d}), it's no
surprise that DM failures are exceedingly common.

Similar to DM failures, posting to the wrong account is also a common mistake.
Because many jobs require posting on social networks on behalf of the company,
it is common to have multiple accounts for personal and business use.
KitchenAid, Chrysler, and Google are three companies whose employees have
made this mistake in the past year~\cite{kitchenaid,chrysler,yegge}.

\section{Research directions}
We propose new research directions based on the following questions.
\begin{itemize}
\item How do users think about identity?
\item What are users already doing to preserve contextual identities?
\item What tasks or topics do users find embarrassing?
\end{itemize}

plethora of cross posting software, too much damn syndication indicates that
many users are on multiple platforms.

\subsection{Inferring contextual identities}
Accurately detecting the user's current contextual identity, whether
heuristically or through asking the user, is paramount to helping the user
manage it.  Although a user may subconsciously be aware of their contextual
identities, expecting users to enumerate their identities and manually curate
them is probably too burdensome. Firefox has a Profile Manager, but it is so
difficult to use that it will be removed.\footnote{See
\url{https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=214675\#c53}.}

Tang et al.~show that most people do not take the time to create labels and
maintain friend lists~\cite{tang}. However, the same authors show how to use
heterogeneous networks to infer relationship types (e.g., manager-subordinate)
though the graph itself is unlabeled.

It may also be possible to infer tasks from the user's activity. For example,
the \texttt{about:profile} Firefox extension uses the Open Directory Project
and Alexa to categorize URLs that the user has visited~\cite{aboutprofile}.

\subsection{Automatic mitigations for information leakage}
One can categorize a user's contextual identities and prevent information
leakage between them.  For example, preventing third-party cookies from being
read and set across task boundaries means that targeted ads for dating would
not follow the user when visiting a technology news site. Knowing the user's
current contextual identity also allows the browser to suppress URL bar
suggestions that aren't relevant to that identity, protecting the user from
both shoulder-surfing and distraction.

Privacy modes in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera are a good first step, but
are no means a complete solution~\cite{ABBJ10}. There is no standard behavior
for private browsing mode, and thus interaction with extensions, treatment of
cookies, history, and bookmarks upon entering and exiting this mode are
different and serve different use cases. Depending on user desire, the threat
model for using private browsing mode may be other household members, or it may
be a service to which the user wants to limit cookie leakage.

Another partial solution is to prompt the user when they're about to link
multiple contextual identities through a federated login service. For example,
Persona is the suite of tools that implements the BrowserID protocol, and it
supports multiple email identifiers~\cite{browserid}.
Because we can categorize the type of service by URL
as \texttt{about:profile} does, Persona could prompt the user when they're about
to link the same email identifier to radically different contextual identities,
such as ones for dating and professional use.

\subsection{Expiring contextual identities}
Oftentimes a user may have a long-term task, such as wedding planning or house
buying, that requires constructing a contextual identity. The tasks associated
with this identity have an externally imposed end date and may have long-lived
side-effects, such as long-term cookies that reveal sensitive information
(e.g., the neighborhood of the house purchase, income information derived from
purchases, other demographic data). For contextual identities that have
outlived their usefulness, users would benefit from destruction of side-effects
such as cookie data.

\subsection{Recovering from Mistakes}
\subsubsection{Auditing}
A major cause of user embarrassment is exposing information to the wrong
audience, as illustrated in section~\ref{sec:examples}. A browser is in an
ideal position to intermediate social network posts, aggregate them locally,
and present them to the user when they desire to audit their digital footprint.
For example, a user could see all of the comments and posts they made in the
last week and redact content that is sensitive or too negative, a frequent cause
of regret~\cite{wang}.  Although this approach does not help when the service
provider decides to change the audience on the user's behalf, auditing gives
the user a good opportunity to review posts that might cause regrets. In the
case of high-volume users, such a tool could incorporate sentiment analysis to
aid the user in finding particularly problematic content.

Profiles can be generated by user-supplied application-level data, but also
implicitly through browsing via tracking techniques.
Collusion is a tool for visualizing cookies~\cite{collusion}, in particular
third-party cookies set by tracking sites which are typically ad networks.
Once the user knows which sites are tracking them, they can choose to block
cookies from those sites.

\subsubsection{Remembering to Forget}
Humans don't have perfect memories, and perhaps social networks should not
either~\cite{delete}. Many users already engage in manual auditing and deletion
of old posts~\cite{fbtips2}. A better solution would be to build tools that let
the user manage this more easily through an API: both Twitter and Facebook
provide APIs for deletion\footnote{At the time of this writing, Google Plus
offers a read-only API.}. One way to reduce the likelihood of linked contextual
identities would be to provide applications that expire posts after some time.

\subsection{Preventing Mistakes}
\subsubsection{Controlling Information Flow}
Sometimes a user might want to prevent mistakes from being made in the first
place. If a user is concerned about a particular service provider, they can
install an extension like Disconnect to disallow cookies from that provider
unless they explicitly want to interact with that site~\cite{disconnect}.
This type of tool (cookie blocker) helps users assert control over audience.

Protocols like Do Not Track are also a good first step to solving this
problem~\cite{dnt}. Although Do Not Track is unenforceable from the client
side, it provides a clear signal to service providers and ad networks that the
user does not want to be tracked. As adoption increases, ignoring this signal
will lead to loss of reputation for service providers that explicitly act
against their users' wishes, helping users assert control over the effects of
their actions.

\subsubsection{Visual reminders of context}
To mitigate privacy violations caused by poor user interfaces, the onus must be
on software developers to provide sufficient visual cues of context. For
example, many but not all Google products support multiple accounts. However,
the visual cue to indicate which account is active is a small, easy to ignore
text name at the top right of the page.

Much work has been done for visual verification of domain authenticity in the
context of phishing, but not much has been done for visual verification of
which user credentials are active~\cite{skins}.

\section{Summary}
People have multiple contextual identities. Sharing personal information in
appropriate contexts fosters positive human interaction.  We hope that
contextual identity will serve as a useful notion for developers to understand
their users' privacy needs, and to develop tools that allow users to act in
their contextual identities in a spontaneous, relaxed, and interesting way.
